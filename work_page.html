					<p class="card-text">After spending two frustrating years trying to study in Poland without success,
						coming to Russia has been a breath of fresh air. My journey took a positive turn when I enrolled
						as an international student in Moscow, and it wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable
						assistance of rovtacinternational.
					</p>
					<p>
						I did my bachelors in Bengaluru,India.
					</p>

					<p class="card-text">First and foremost, the hostel I reside in is not only comfortable but also
						surprisingly affordable, with a monthly cost of just 2500 Rupees. The facilities are on par with
						what you'd find in a place like New York, yet the price is astonishingly reasonable.</p>

					<p class="card-text">When it comes to food expenses, it's pleasantly comparable to the cost of
						living in my hometown of Kerala. I didn't have to worry about breaking the bank just to enjoy a
						good meal.</p>

					<p class="card-text">The people in Moscow have been incredibly friendly and welcoming. It's
						refreshing to be in a place where you're surrounded by warm-hearted individuals who make you
						feel at ease. The atmosphere here is always cool, creating a relaxed and stress-free
						environment.</p>

					<p class="card-text">What's more, I was fortunate to secure a job with a decent salary.
						Learning russian is important to get better opportunities.This added financial stability has
						made my study abroad experience even more
						rewarding, allowing me to explore and enjoy my time in Moscow to the fullest.</p>

					<p class="card-text">In retrospect, my initial setbacks in trying to go to Poland now feel like a
						blessing in disguise. Moscow has proven to be an incredible destination for my educational and
						personal growth. I couldn't be more grateful for the positive turn my journey has taken.</p>

					<p class="card-text">My journey to study abroad was initially a rollercoaster of disappointment. I
						spent one long years attempting to make it to Poland, but it seemed like an unattainable dream
						that was never meant to be. Frustration and setbacks were the norm during that time, and I began
						to lose hope.</p>
					<p class="card-text">My current accommodation is a true gem - it combines comfort and affordability
						in the heart of Moscow. Remarkably, it only sets me back 2500 Rupees each month, a fraction of
						what you might expect in many super cities, yet it offers facilities that rival those in more
						expensive places.</p>

					<p class="card-text">The grocery costs are so affordable.</p>

					<p class="card-text">To top it off, luck smiled upon me, and I landed a job in kfc,the experience is
						so high as me expected,
						but I have a faith of moving to new job after learnig Russian. This newfound financial stability
						has elevated my study
						abroad experience, giving me the freedom to explore and relish my time in Moscow to the fullest.
